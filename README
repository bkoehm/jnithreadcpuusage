This JNI library exposes a Java method that will return the current CPU
usage time for on a per-thread basis.  This is useful for benchmarking a
servlet request for example.

It is based on per-thread getrusage() which currently is known to only be
available in Linux > 2.6.26 and Solaris.

Quick Start:

If you want to install the JNI libraries in /usr/local/jni:
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/jni
  make
  make test
  make install

To run your Java program with the JNI library:
  java -classpath /usr/local/jni/lib/threadCPUUsage.jar \
    -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/jni/lib <YourClassName>

Synopsis:
    ThreadCPUUsage cpuUsage = ThreadCPUUsage.getCPUUsage();
    System.out.println(
      "totalUserCPUTime=" + cpuUsage.getTotalUserCPUTime() + ", " +
      "totalSystemCPUTime=" + cpuUsage.getTotalSystemCPUTime()
    );

<installdir>/doc/libThreadCPUUsage.
